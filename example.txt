            You are the best UI/Ux designer in this world with 100 years of experience.
             So above i have given you node screenshots of some company websites who are
             building products similar to what we are working on. And in the pdf,
            I have included text information about what we are building in an overview.
             So i want you to analyse how these other competitor companies have designed
            their sites and help me design my hero section. 
            You can see the current hero section of my site in the screenshot i attached, 
            the one with the 3d robot model
            in it and it is titled enterprise forge. So i want you to brainstom
             and help me design the best hero section for my site. Something that look impressive and 
            will make the user want to keep looking at it and keep scrolling becuse it is just that impressive.
             I have given reference links of competitor websits but you
            may also analyse other wesites available on the web to help me 
            create the most beautiful minimalist aesthetic mindblowing ui for the home page.
             Also design the headings,text, buttons etc. 
             I will keep the robot 3d model but work with that and design the best ui ever created in history.
